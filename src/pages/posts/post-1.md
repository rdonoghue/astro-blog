# My Notes

- Ok, I just pasted in a bunch of stuff, and I'm looking to parse it
- Looks like this tutorial is from 2022, and it's probably a good sign that it still works
- Not clear what that image is going to be, though I wager it's maybe a blog preview?
- I'm curious about the naming convention and how much it's strictly necessary

# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2025-06-25

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

Also, i will purge this post with fire, since leaving it up would be kind of mortifying.
